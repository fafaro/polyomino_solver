# Polyomino Solver
This is a desktop app written in C#. It solves the [problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino#Tiling_regions_with_sets_of_polyominoes) of arranging a given set of polyomino shapes in a rectangular region. It uses the [Dancing Links](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047v1.pdf) algorithm by Donald E. Knuth. 

Here's a video showing how it works:
